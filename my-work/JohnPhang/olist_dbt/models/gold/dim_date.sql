{{ config(materialized='table') }}

-- This model creates a date dimension table, which is a common component in data warehousing. 
-- The date dimension allows for easy analysis of data across different time periods (e.g., by year, quarter, month, etc.). 
-- The date range is determined based on the minimum order purchase timestamp and the maximum estimated delivery date 
-- from the `stg_orders` staging table.
-- This generates dates from the order date fields.
